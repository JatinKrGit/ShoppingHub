                                        <br />
                                        <br />This section deals with conditions relating to the sale of products on the website by us to you.

                                        <br />
                                        <br />&nbsp;<strong><span class="auto-style13">2. Our Contract

</span></strong>
                                        <br />
                                        <br />Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when the product is dispatched to you and an e-mail confirmation is sent to you that the product has been dispatched to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.

Your contract is with us (the Sellers) and you confirm that the product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purpose. You authorize us to declare and provide declaration to any governmental authority on your behalf stating the aforesaid purpose of the products ordered by you on the website.

You can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.

Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.

                                        <br /><strong>
                                        <br />&nbsp; </strong>Item was defective

                                        <br />&nbsp;Return could also result in refund of money in most of the cases.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Points to be noted:

                                        <br />&nbsp; Seller can always accept the return irrespective of the policy.
                                        <br />&nbsp; If Seller disagrees a return request, Buyer can file a dispute under the Buyer Protection Program*.
